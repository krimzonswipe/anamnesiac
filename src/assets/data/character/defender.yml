  notes: >
      _A2 gets buffed to her initial JP values. She is now probably the best defender in the game now her Single Target Damage buff
      isn't holding her back. She provides AP feeding with dodging, she has post rush-sustain. Her damage is good and she can run
      a ranged or melee combo. She is reasonably bulky as well and really only the slow clunky play style is her biggest downside
      along with that HP buffs are anything but consistent. Like the rest of the nier trio she's pretty broken and you'll be seeing
      many on auto in your m3 runs to come._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Perfect dodging restores AP to the party
      
      - Strong buffs for both offense and defence.
      
      - High personal damage output, especially post rush.
      
      - Post rush regen gives sustain.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - HP based talents aren't consistent without setting up a proper composition

      _Victor is the starter defender and a non-ace, so if you picked him you kind of got a bad deal. However Victor is actually a
      solid defender who boasts incredible defensive utility and is quite difficult to kill. He increases the party's DEF by 50% and
      offers a weak damage buff. His post rush buff also decreases damage taken by 50%. His rush gain is pretty good due to his move
      set and he is worth considering limit breaking due to the cheaper cost of 5 stars and the fact certain permanent aces such as
      Dias aren't significantly better than him._
      
      
      _His down sides are the fact he offers little to the offensive side of the game. His
      damage buff is over written by so many commonly used characters, it'll generally be irrelavant. Also his best rush gain move
      sends enemies sky high during elemental burst meaning it can't be used. His personal dps is passable, but not amazing and moves
      like mirror blade are also a bit awkward to use. In summary, Viktor is a human wall, he's good at surviving and increasing
      party tankiness. But he doesn't offer much to the parties damage in return, however, if you want a defender on a budget till a 
      limited defender comes along, he's worth keeping in mind._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - 5 star non-ace so cheaper to augment and limit break
      
      - Great defensive buffs
      
      - Hard to kill
      
      - Good rush gain
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - 5 star non-ace so has less stats
      
      - Bloodstorm Revolution likes to send enemies skyward
      
      - No damage based buffs
      
      
      **Rotation**
      
      *Normal > Bloodstorm Revolution > Bloodstorm Revolution (Rush gain 100AP rotation)*
      
      *Normal > Bloodstorm Revolution > Dragon Roar > Bloodstorm Revolution (Rush gain 105AP rotation)*
      
      *Normal > Bloodstorm Revolution > Dragon Roar > Mirror Blade (Damage Rotation)*

      _Summer Myuria comes along to remind us she's the only alt Myuria has gotten even in JP. Which is a tragedy. As a tank SMyu is
      a solid option. She has a solid ranged combo, and aura wall gives her a good way to contribute to hit counter. Her talents 
      are a mixture of solid defence with some good offensive ones. They do require for her to hold aggro but her ranged skills help
      her do that well enough, but taking an accessory which gives taunt will help her do this massively.She also happens to be the
      only defender who reduces INT damage taken currently. Giving her a unique niche in that regard. Her rush also hits pretty
      hard which is a nice bonus._
      
      
      _Her biggest downside is her notoriously abysmal rush gain, some healers gain rush faster than her 
      even it's so bad. In the hands of a very good player this can be offset somewhat, but it requires you to play very well. In 
      summary Summer Myuria is a solid character but her extremely slow rush gain leaves a lot to be desired._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Solid ranged attacks
      
      - Anti-flinch and HP buff
      
      - Buffs herself and her party as long as she holds aggro
      
      - INT damage reduction unique to her among defenders.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Extremely slow rush gain
      
      - Aura wall is good for hit count, but bad for damage.
      
      
      **Rotation**
      
      *Normal > Aura Wall > Air Slash > Thunderfire Slash > spam this until no AP - (need 4-5 AP seeds damage rotation)*
      
      *Normal > Air Slash > Thunderfire Slash > Air Slash > Thunderfire Slash > spam this until no AP (Range rotation)*

      _Dias is the first Ace permanent defender to come to global and is pretty good. He's an improvement over Viktor but isn't going
      to blow people away. He provides defensive buffs to the whole party, but he only gives a weak damage buff to attackers and
      defenders, and only gives anti-flinch to characters weaking close range weapons. This means his buffs aren't really relevant to
      ranged characters and with our current defender pool, reduces his relevancy because of this._
      
      
      _He has a solid enough ranged combo
      and decent damage, his post rush buff helps him really out put some damage by reducing AP cost by 50% but does nothing for the
      party. In summary, Dias is a good character, but only good and will slowly become outclassed over time. Compared to other 
      defenders he feels like the one least worth limit breaking._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Solid ranged attacks
      
      - Strong party wide defensive buff.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Most of his buffs are redundant for ranged characters.
      
      - Has attacks which send enemies airborne during Elemental Burst

      _Evelysse has decided for Christmas, she'd like to not be forgotten on the sidelines as a pretty average healer. Instead she
      wants to enter the ring to steal A2's crown as defender queen. On top of making a Christmas Eve pun. Winter Evelysse is the
      first character who provides direct competition to a Nier character that's truly worth considering. xEve is part of the hit
      count characters that started with Halloween and continue in the Christmas limited characters._
      
      
      _She's a bulkier A2 which deals
      less damage in exchange. She provides the usual anti-flinch and HP buff which is common among defenders, while also providing
      a party wide defensive buff that reduces ATK damage taken as long as the hit count is over 50, which is an easy goal to reach.
      Offensively she provides a 20% single target damage buff without condition beating out A2 if you aren't at 100% HP. If you reach
      150 hits, this increases to a pretty sizeable 40% buff. She has a strong ranged combo and twin helix helps bring the close range
      pain, post rush she can spam her attacks even more with an AP reduction buff and also buffing her attack allowing her to get
      a lot of damage out._
      
      
      _Downsides is that she lacks any sustain, so she requires some form of healing from a party member or
      her equipment. Her Helix Blade also does launch enemies during elemental burst, but not that high that it is super awkward for 
      other melee to hit them._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Solid ranged attacks
      
      - Strong party wide defensive buffs
      
      - Powerful offensive buffs
      
      - Decent dps
      
      - Good synergy with other hit count characters
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Lacks personal healing
      
      - Helix Blade launches people

      _Edge has finally joined the fray to increase the defender pool and brings some talents worth considering, especially if you
      pull him and lack a defender currently. While he may not be as good as the two queens of tanking of A2 and xEve. He is still
      good and his HP buff inparticular is worth taking notice as it means other defenders really like him. He does have some 
      offensive buffs, but at this point there are a few characters with superior buffs that'll outclass them. His post rush buff is
      nice but there are other characters with the same buff, including the ever popular 2B, and you do see Fayt and Halloween Millie
      around as well, hurting that buff further._
      
      
      _To summarise, it's not that Edge is a bad character, his biggest problem is that he's
      not a great one, he's entering a role that while the pool may be small, has two of the strongest characters in the game already 
      in it who simply outclass him. His HP buff will always be relevant though and he'll be a solid choice for pubbing so if you want
      a defender and don't have A2 or xEve he is recommended if you like the way he plays._

      _Miki has now entered the defender pool and decided to continue her character trend of being not very good. However for a freebie
      welfare unit, she's actually a decent character. Her buffing is limited to supporting invokers and healing, meaning she wants a
      specific party composition. She does provide an INT and DEF buff to all characters, empwoering Invokers and Healers inparticular
      but giving a little bit of bulkiness to her party in general. Her biggest strength is she's even harder than Viktor to kill,
      which is saying something. Her grit chance isn't as high but is still 70% and requires a smaller amount of max HP. On top of
      that she has a pretty large in built life steal that synergises with her grit chance which is why she's just so tanky._
      
      
      _Obviously
      though her buffs aren't great, the lack of anti-flinch for the 3 more popular roles gives it the same redundancy that Dias has
      issues with. Bloodstorm and Nether also send character sky high during elemental burst and she only has one ranged attack. Plus
      with her in built life steal Vampiric Flash is pointless._

      _Rain clocks in as another top toer defender in our current meta. Alongside high damage, he brings a 10% stat debuff that 
      can chunk a surprising amount of a boss's inflated stats, which cannot be understated. This also makes him especially strong 
      alongside other defenders in single player parties. His global buffs elevate him even further as well, he now has a superior HP
      buff to A2 and xEve so will make theirs redundant, only Edge can better his 30% HP buff. Plus a multiplier increase of 110 on
      his best skill of Lava Floor, making him pack a serious punch now._
      
      
      _Finally, One-Handed Sword is a weapon type that covers many 
      different elements, letting him exploit weaknesses more often than A2 and xEve at this stage. In summary the global buffs to his
      HP buff and damage, alongside the flexibility of his weapon type and his unconditional buffs makes Rain one of the best
      defenders on GL, leaving A2 inparticular a little nervous. Rain is easily the best of the three FFBE units._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - High DPS output

  notes: >
      _Dias was the first defender ace we had and is rewarded by being the first defender to be awakened. Rather then try and give
      him a more all round kit like other top defenders, Dias doubles down on his composition oriented talents, in some cases
      he literally doubles them. First off we'll go over his kit. His moves are fine, a little dated but the buffs to them help
      increase damage output, on top of that he now has a big +50% self boost to his ATK. He has also gotten better at giving party
      bulk with his DEF buff now at 25% for the party and reducing ATK damage by 25% only 5% less then the best ATK damage reduction
      going._
      
      _His composition focused talents want him accompanied by only attackers and defenders, which sounds like Claude may be a good
      pick to go alongside him. No only does he provide a large 30% anti-flinch buff, he essentially replaces the sharpshooters by
      giving a 40% damage buff, matching that of base Maria._
      
      _His additional talents are underwhelming, taunt +3 should help him hold aggro and his other talent helps him regenerate health
      by CAing. The latter can be good for sustain, especially if you're good with CA or you use it to CA away from a foe as his
      ranged attacks remain his best. The downsides are more his composition specific talents and his skill selection doesn't have
      much of a spammable powerhouse like Winter Evelysse or Rain have._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Solid ranged attacks
      
      - Strong party wide defensive buff.
      
      - Very good in a comp with just Attackers and defenders.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Some of his buffs are redundant for ranged characters.
      
      - Still the greatest pusher of all time.
      
      - Skill selection is a little lacklustre.
      
      
      **Rotation**
      
      *Normal > Annihiliating Air Slash > Double Slash > Annihiliating Air Slash > spam this until no AP - (Damage rotation)*
      
      *Annihiliating Air Slash > Dragon Roar > Annihiliating Air Slash > Dragon Roar > spam this until no AP - (Range rotation)*
